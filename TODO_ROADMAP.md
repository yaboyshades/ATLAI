## 📋 ACTIVE TODO LIST

### 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (P1) - Core Stability
- [ ] **Add fallback & concurrency tests**
  - Tests: no tools => fallback; re-entrant input queued; stale completion metric increments
  - Location: `tests/core/test_concurrency.py`
  - Blockers: Need mailbox pressure test scenarios
  - Metrics: mailbox_pressure=0.80, stale_rate=0.12 (HIGH alerts)

- [ ] **Complete type hardening for execution_flow.py**
  - Fix remaining type annotation issues from patching
  - Location: `src/core/execution_flow.py` lines 45-60
  - Add Protocol/TypedDict imports from tool_types.py
  - Metrics: Static analysis errors = 3

- [ ] **Address FSM edge case handling**
  - Handle rapid state transitions under load
  - Add circuit breaker for excessive mailbox growth
  - Location: `src/core/states.py`
  - Target: mailbox_pressure < 0.50

### 🎯 MEDIUM PRIORITY (P2) - Enhanced Capabilities
- [ ] **Update Grafana dashboard with new metrics**
  - Add panels for concurrency metrics (mailbox, stale, ignored)
  - Add planning metrics (risk score, todo priorities)
  - Location: `config/grafana/super-alita-dashboard.json`
  - Dependencies: Prometheus endpoint validation

- [ ] **Enhance documentation**
  - Update `docs/self-insight-setup.md` with new features
  - Document fallback behavior and concurrency patterns
  - Add troubleshooting guide for metrics alerts
  - Dependencies: Final testing of all features

- [ ] **Neo4j integration (optional)**
  - Wire real Neo4j queries for policy/personality/consolidation
  - Add feature flag for Neo4j vs mock data
  - Location: `src/core/kg_api_server.py`
  - Risk: Low priority, mock data sufficient for most use cases

### 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (P3) - Advanced Features
- [ ] **Multi-agent coordination prep**
  - Outline interface changes for multiple sessions
  - Design shared event bus with agent isolation
  - Add agent-to-agent communication patterns
  - Research: Requires architectural design phase

- [ ] **Advanced metrics and alerting**
  - Machine learning for anomaly detection
  - Predictive health scoring
  - Auto-tuning of thresholds based on workload
  - Dependencies: Extended operational data

- [ ] **Performance optimization**
  - Event bus connection pooling
  - Metrics aggregation and batching
  - Cache optimization for frequent queries
  - Target: <100ms response times for all endpoints
